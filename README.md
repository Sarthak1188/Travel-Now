# Travelling-Website: UK Travels

UK Travels aims to promote tourism by providing information about popular travel destinations. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly and interactive experience for travelers and tourists.

In this website I have used a JavaScript Library called Swipper.js which provides some very interactive features about the website basically the sliding effect.
Basically it is a frontend project of very responsive and interactive website which promotes the tourism of Uttarakhand
